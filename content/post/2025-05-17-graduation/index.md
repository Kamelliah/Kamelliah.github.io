Set to graduate with my Master's in Healthcare Administration, this milestone represents the culmination of years of hard work, leadership growth, and a deepening commitment to improving healthcare systems and advancing equity.

This journey has been transformative, challenging me to think critically about healthcare policy, organizational leadership, and the social determinants that shape health outcomes. Through rigorous coursework, practical experiences, and collaboration with incredible peers and faculty, I've developed the skills and perspective needed to make meaningful contributions to the healthcare field.

The graduate hooding ceremony at UW-La Crosse will mark not just an academic achievement, but a commitment to using this education to drive positive change. From improving access to care to championing health equity initiatives, I'm excited to apply what I've learned to real-world challenges.

I'm grateful to my family, mentors, and classmates who supported me throughout this journey. As I turn the tassel, I look forward to the opportunities ahead and the impact I hope to make in healthcare administration.
