      text: |
        As a graduate of the Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA) program and a current student in the Master of Public Health (MPH) program at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, I am proud to present a portfolio that reflects my competencies in healthcare leadership, policy analysis, and systems management. Each project showcased below demonstrates how my academic and professional journey has strengthened my ability to bridge administrative strategy with population health outcomes.
