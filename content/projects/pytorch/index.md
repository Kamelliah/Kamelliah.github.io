Through an **EHR data analysis project in HCA 715**, I gained experience evaluating operational performance and identifying optimization opportunities.  
In **HCA 700**, I conducted a **rural healthcare systems analysis** to address inefficiencies and propose strategies for expanding service access in underserved communities.
