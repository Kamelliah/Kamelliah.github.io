## Project Overview

For my Capstone project, I partnered with Circle of Hope, Inc II, an organization dedicated to providing support for physically and developmentally disabled women. The organization faced significant challenges with outdated employee handbook policies and rising recruitment costs due to changes in pricing on recruitment platforms like Indeed. This project aimed to address these issues by refining and standardizing the employee handbook, developing cost-effective hiring strategies, and streamlining the onboarding process. The ultimate goal was to enhance the operational efficiency of the organization while reducing hiring costs and improving employee integration.

The project was designed with the following objectives:

1. **Improve Operational Efficiencies**
   
   By revising the employee handbook and recruitment strategies, this project sought to enhance overall organizational workflow and employee satisfaction.

2. **Reduce Hiring Costs**
   
   By analyzing changes in Indeed's pricing model, I explored alternative hiring methods and developed more cost-effective recruitment strategies.

## Methodology

The project utilized a combination of in-person observations, remote development, and strategic planning sessions to achieve its goals:

### In-Person Observations

I conducted biweekly site visits to assess workflow efficiency and gain insights into the organization's operational challenges.

### Remote Development and Testing

I worked remotely to digitize onboarding materials and refine hiring strategies, using feedback from the site visits.

### Strategic Meetings

Weekly consultations with site supervisors and stakeholders allowed me to refine strategies and ensure alignment with the organization's goals.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 – Handbook Review & Refinement
**January 28 – February 15, 2025**

Audited the current employee handbook, revised outdated policies, and ensured legal compliance. I developed training materials based on industry best practices, ensuring that all policies were legally compliant and clear.

### Phase 2 – Hiring Strategy Development
**February 16 – March 15, 2025**

Analyzed the pricing changes on Indeed and other recruitment platforms. I explored cost-effective alternatives such as local job boards, community partnerships, and employee referral programs. This phase resulted in a comprehensive hiring strategy that reduced reliance on expensive platforms.

### Phase 3 – Onboarding Process Design
**March 16 – April 15, 2025**

Created standardized onboarding checklists and training materials to streamline the integration of new employees. The materials included digital resources and step-by-step guides tailored to the organization's needs.

### Phase 4 – Implementation & Testing
**April 16 – May 10, 2025**

Implemented the revised handbook policies and new hiring strategies. Conducted pilot onboarding sessions with new hires to test the effectiveness of the materials and made adjustments based on feedback.

### Phase 5 – Evaluation & Final Report
**May 11 – May 21, 2025**

Evaluated the success of the project through key performance indicators such as hiring cost reduction, employee satisfaction, and onboarding efficiency. Compiled findings into a final report with recommendations for future improvements.

## Deliverables & Evaluation

The project delivered several key outputs:

- **Revised Employee Handbook**: Policies were updated for clarity, compliance, and alignment with best practices. The revised handbook aimed to foster a more efficient and cohesive work environment.

- **Cost-Effective Hiring Strategy**: A detailed analysis of Indeed's pricing changes and alternative recruitment platforms, accompanied by recommendations for more affordable methods of sourcing candidates.

- **Standardized Onboarding Materials**: New onboarding checklists and training materials were developed to ensure smooth integration of new hires into the organization.

The success of the project was measured by the following evaluation criteria:

- **Hiring Cost Reduction**: A comparison of recruitment costs before and after the new strategies were implemented.
- **Employee Handbook Effectiveness**: An assessment of employee satisfaction with the new policies and their adherence to updated guidelines.
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: A measurement of new hires' time-to-productivity, gauging the success of the new onboarding process through feedback and assessment reports.

## Cumulative Reflection

This Capstone project served as a comprehensive demonstration of my growth across all five program competencies. It required strategic systems thinking to evaluate hiring inefficiencies, effective leadership to implement organizational change, ethical judgment in policy revisions, communication and collaboration with stakeholders, and the application of data-informed decision-making to develop cost-effective solutions. The project not only allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting but also reinforced my commitment to improving operational systems in healthcare and social service organizations.

Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of human resource management, the importance of adaptive strategies in response to external changes, and the critical role of clear communication in driving organizational success. The project has prepared me to take on leadership roles in healthcare administration, where strategic thinking, operational efficiency, and employee engagement are paramount.
